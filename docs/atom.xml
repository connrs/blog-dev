    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ðŸ˜Ÿ They found the submarine. I mean, tax the fucking fuck out of billionaires but damn that's not how I'd want anyone to go.</p>
<p>I found a bunch of my old blog archives and had a think about restoring them here. I wont. I don't ever remember sounding like a pompous dick but there you go. I perfected the fine art of sounding like a tool over RSS back in the mid-noughts.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just kidding, this isn't a sunk cost. I was listening to a Youtube video recently and the present couldn't remember the phrase she wanted to use. I couldn't remember either until I was idly cooking one evening and remembered what it was.</p>
<p>However, I'm fully buying in to doing static site generation now. I put it off forever because I really couldn't be bothered with setting it all up but I've reached the point now where I'm done with things not working and at least with this setup I can just bloody well edit some HTML if it really needs doing.</p>
<p>Yes, I could have done it with Jekyll and I picked Hakyll anyway because Haskell.</p>
<p>I hope they find that submarine btw. ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>]]></summary>
